# We will be creating our first web design 🎉

We will be using what we have covered so far such such as FlexBox. We want our end result to be something like this:

![](/images/final_product.png?raw=true)


### Set up

 - **Fork and clone** this repo.
   - To fork, hit the 'fork' button in the top right corner of this page on Github. 
  Now you should be on your own Github repository - you'll know this because your name should now be in the repo name at the top of the Github page. 
   - To clone, click the green button that says 'Code' on that page and copy the link to clone to your own machine.
  Now the code is on your own machine (this happened when you cloned), AND it's linked to your own our-first-webite repository on Github (which was created when you forked).

# Instructions

 - **Edit `index.html` and `style.css`** to re-create the design above.
   - Style each element using CSS to make a perfect copy of the above image. 
   - All the images and icons you need can be found in the `images` folder.
   - **Only create the desktop design** for now. 

### Submitting your work
 - **Commit and push your code often** (for example every half an hour)so you get into the habit and you avoid losing any code that you write if your machine crashes for example. 
 - Once you're ready to submit your for review, do a final push and **create a Pull Request**.
